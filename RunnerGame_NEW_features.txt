=> Ideas of new features and further development:

OK! + Optimize game (FPS, sound, etc.) to make it work in smartphones (at least Android)
+ Add menu with different sections: Settings, About, Languages, etc.
OK! + Possibility to change player's speed (run faster, slow down)
+ Add different obstacles (from above)
+ Add platforms where the player can jump
+ Booster to jump higher
+ Booster for imunization against obstacles
+ Leaderboard with top score players
+ SNS integration: Facebook, Google+ to invite friends, share progress, etc.
+ Add more levels
+ Add a boss enemy to play against in the end of the level
+ etc. - any other ideas you may have :) 

++ Multiplayer option
